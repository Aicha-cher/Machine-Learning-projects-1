Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning Projects by using Python Scikit-Learn


## What is this repository about?

When I do some works, I would love to share with people and exchange the knowledges, in this case, we can learn from each other
and help each other to improve the coding skills.There are 2 projects that I have used Machine learning algorithms by applying Python.
I love to share my knowledge with people and also see how people put their opinion on it.

## What projects are in this repository?

- Unsupervised Learning

**Identify customer segments for a mail-order sales company in Germany**

>I have used 2 large demographics data for this project. By applying the unsupervised learning knowledge, training the unlabeled customer segement data. Finding out which segements have the most revenue or return for the company. By defining the best customer segments, it can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.

- Supervised Learning

**Finding Donors for CharityML**

>The goal of this project is find the people who are most possible to become a donor for Charity ML by looking at all the features of each person. All the people are labled, so we can use supervised learning theory to complete this project. Train, test and validate the data, finally the result will tell us what are the features which can influence on the peopleÂ´decision to become a donor.


## What you can do with my projects?

You can feel free to comment on my projects, find the bugs or tell me what your thoughts about my coding, analysis and insight. You can contact with me through my email: saizhang123@gmail.com. I will love to hear your ideas.
You can also take some codes away if you think some of them can be useful for your projects.
